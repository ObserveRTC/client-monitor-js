/**
 * Synthesized Samples Detector
 * 
 * Detects when audio playout contains synthesized (artificially generated) samples.
 * Synthesized samples are typically inserted by the audio subsystem when there's
 * insufficient audio data due to network issues, jitter, or packet loss, helping
 * maintain continuous audio playback.
 * 
 * **Detection Logic:**
 * - Monitors `deltaSynthesizedSamplesDuration` from media playout statistics
 * - Triggers when synthesized sample duration exceeds configured minimum threshold
 * - Indicates potential audio quality degradation due to missing audio data
 * 
 * **Configuration Options:**
 * - `disabled`: Boolean to enable/disable the detector
 * - `createIssue`: Whether to create ClientIssue when synthesized samples are detected
 * - `minSynthesizedSamplesDuration`: Minimum duration threshold to trigger detection
 * 
 * **Events Emitted:**
 * - `synthesized-audio`: Emitted when synthesized samples exceed threshold
 * 
 * **Issues Created:**
 * - Type: `synthesized-audio`
 * - Payload: `{ deltaSynthesizedSamplesDuration }`
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Configuration
 * const config = {
 *   syntheticSamplesDetector: {
 *     disabled: false,
 *     createIssue: true,
 *     minSynthesizedSamplesDuration: 100 // milliseconds
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * // Listen for synthesized audio events
 * monitor.on('synthesized-audio', ({ mediaPlayoutMonitor, deltaSynthesizedSamplesDuration }) => {
 *   console.log('Synthesized audio detected:', deltaSynthesizedSamplesDuration, 'ms');
 * });
 * ```
