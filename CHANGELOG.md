## 4.1.0

### Major Features

-   **Issue Resolution Management**: Introduced `resolveActiveIssues()` method to manage and resolve active issues in real-time
    -   Issues can now be resolved by filter function or by direct reference
    -   Method returns remaining active issues after resolution
    -   Emits `resolved-issue` events when issues are resolved
-   **Active Issues Tracking**: Added `activeIssues` property to ClientMonitor to track all currently active issues by type
-   **Extension Stats Providers**: Implemented extensible stats provider system for injecting custom application metrics
    -   Supports both synchronous and asynchronous providers
    -   Custom stats are automatically included in every sample
    -   Allows correlation of WebRTC metrics with application-specific data

### Improvements

-   **Issue vs Event Distinction**: Clear separation between Issues (resolvable problems) and Events (immutable notifications)
    -   Issues can be resolved when the problem goes away
    -   Events are permanent records of what happened
    -   Detectors now properly use `createIssue` or `createEvent` based on the type of notification
-   **Multiple Event Emissions**: Dry track detectors can now emit multiple events during a single dry period, providing more granular tracking
-   **Detector Configuration**: Clarified and corrected detector configuration comments to reflect actual implementation
    -   `syntheticSamplesDetector` and `longPcConnectionEstablishmentDetector` use `createEvent`
    -   All other detectors use `createIssue`

### Documentation

-   **Enhanced README**: Comprehensive documentation on issue management and resolution
    -   New "Managing Active Issues" section with practical examples
    -   Clear explanation of Events vs Issues distinction
    -   Extended "Extension Stats Providers" subsection in "Collecting and Adapting Stats"
-   **Configuration Comments**: Updated `ClientMonitorConfig.ts` with accurate descriptions of each detector's configuration options

### Bug Fixes

-   **Dry Inbound Track Detector**: Added missing `_evented` flag check to prevent duplicate event emissions
-   **Configuration Consistency**: Fixed property names in detector configurations (`createEvent` vs `createIssue`)

### Migration Notes

This is a minor version update with no breaking changes. Existing applications will continue to work as-is. New applications can take advantage of:

-   The `resolveActiveIssues()` method for dynamic issue management
-   Extension stats providers for custom application metrics
-   Improved issue resolution and tracking capabilities

## 4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

-   **Schema v3.0.0**: Upgraded to use schema version 3.0.0 for sampling with new data structures
-   **API Refactor**: Complete ClientMonitor API refactor with breaking changes
-   **Detector Architecture**: Rewritten detector and monitor system for better performance

### Major Features

-   **Enhanced Detectors**: Added comprehensive documentation and unit tests for all detectors
-   **Score System**: Improved scoring system with detailed score reasons for tracks and connections
-   **Event Handling**: Enhanced event system with better payload handling and new event listeners
-   **Stats Adapters**: Refactored stats adapter architecture for improved statistics collection
-   **Issue Creation**: Added configurable `createIssue` flag across all detectors

### Configuration & Build

-   **Build Process**: Updated to TypeScript compiler with ES module support and minification
-   **Package Config**: Enhanced package.json with better entry points and Node.js 14+ requirement
-   **Documentation**: Restructured documentation with comprehensive README and examples

### Migration Notes

This is a major version with breaking changes. Applications using v3.x will need to update API usage, detector configurations, and event handlers to work with the new architecture.

## 3.0.0

-   The ClientMonitor API is simplified and refactored.

## 2.3.0

-   refactored collectors and sampler
-   `clientMontior.os` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.operationSystem`
-   `clientMontior.engine` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.engine`
-   `clientMontior.browser` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.browser`
-   `clientMontior.audioInputs` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.audioInputs`
-   `clientMontior.audioOutputs` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.audioOutputs`
-   `clientMontior.videoInputs` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.videoInputs`
-   `clientMonitor.alerts` is removed, `clientMonitor.audioDesyncDetector`, `clientMonitor.cpuPerformanceDetector`, and `clientMonitor.congestionDetector`
-   all `updates` fields in storage entries are moved to the entries of the `storage`
-   `metrics` field is removed `elapsedSinceLastCollectInMs` and `elapsedSinceLastSampleInMs` is added to the `stats-collected`, and `sample-created` events
-   refactored mediasoup-collector
-   add events are collected automatically
-   simplified configuration, and detectors configurations are moved to create detectors

## 2.1.0

-   Remove dependency @observertc/samples-schema
-   Add Samples and W3cStats to the source under the `./src/schema` library

## 2.0.0

### Conceptual changes

-   The ClientMonitor is no longer responsible for WebSocket connections, signaling, and transports.
-   The ClientMonitor has become responsible for the following event emissions:
    -   PEER_CONNECTION_OPENED, PEER_CONNECTION_CLOSED
    -   MEDIA_TRACK_ADDED, MEDIA_TRACK_REMOVED
    -   ICE_CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGED
-   Specific collectors can add additional call events. For example, mediasoup adds PRODUCER_PAUSED, PRODUCER_RESUMED, CONSUMER_PAUSED, CONSUMER_RESUMED events.
-   ClientMonitor calculate derived metrics such as sending, and receiving bitrates, total sent and received packets.

### Major Code changes

-   Removed Sender component and corresponding configuration from ClientMonitor.
-   Removed Transport component, as sending and transporting no longer fall under the responsibility of the ClientMonitor.
-   Storage StatsEntries `id` is renamed to `statsId`.
-   PeerConnectionEntry `collectorId` is renamed to `id`, and `collectorLabel` to `label`.
-   Removed `setUserId`, `setCallId`, `setClientId`, `setRoomId`, and `marker` from ClientMonitor, as this information should be used for context creation on the server side, which falls under the responsibility of signaling.
-   Removed `events` field from ClientMonitor, as events have become part of the ClientMonitor itself, and ClientMonitor now provides `on`, `off`, `once` interfaces for events.

### Functionality changes

-   Stats are removed based on visited ids in getStats. If a stat is no longer present in the getStats extracted result, it is removed from the Storage.

### Configuration changes

-   Sampler configuration is reduced.
-   Sender configuration is removed.
-   `statsExpirationTimeInMs` is removed.
-   `createCallEvents` is added.
