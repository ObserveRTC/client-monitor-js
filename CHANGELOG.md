## 4.4.1

### Bug Fixes

-   Added `dataChannels` to peer connection sample serialization so tracked data channel stats are included in `ClientSample.peerConnections[].dataChannels`.

## 4.3.0

### Major Features

-   **Issue Lifecycle Rework**: The issue system has been rebuilt around a stateful raise/resolve lifecycle keyed by an explicit `key` string. One-shot logging stays available; stateful issues that can be cleared now have a first-class API.
    -   `raiseIssue(key, { type, payload?, timestamp? })`: Creates (or refreshes) a stateful issue. Re-raising with the same `key` updates the entry in place and emits `'issue-updated'` instead of `'issue'`.
    -   `resolveIssue(key, { comment?, payload?, resolvedAt? })`: Resolves a single stateful issue by its `key`. The optional `payload` overwrites the active issue's payload, so detectors enrich the resolved record with episode-level info such as `durationInMs`.
    -   `addIssue({ type, payload?, timestamp? })`: Kept for one-shot, non-stateful issues (e.g. `USER_MEDIA_ERROR`). Emits `'issue'` and buffers into the next sample but never enters the active store and cannot be resolved.
    -   `getActiveIssuesByType(type?)`: Snapshot of currently active stateful issues, optionally filtered by type.
    -   `isIssueActive(key)`: True when a stateful issue with the given key is currently active.
    -   `activeIssues` is now a public read-mostly `Map<string, RaisedClientIssue>` keyed by `key` (previously `Record<string, ClientIssue[]>`).
-   **Discriminated Union for Built-In Issues**: New `ClientMonitorIssue` and `ClientMonitorResolvedIssue` unions narrow `payload` from the `type` discriminator. `switch (issue.type)` inside an `'issue'` / `'issue-resolved'` listener gives full payload typing for every detector that ships with the library, plus `isClientMonitorIssue` / `isClientMonitorResolvedIssue` runtime type guards.
-   **Detector Runtime Toggle**: Every built-in detector now carries a `public disabled = false` field. Flip it at any time (`monitor.detectors` or via the parent peer-connection / track instance) to silence a detector without removing it. `Detectors.update()` skips `disabled === true` entries, and each detector's own `update()` short-circuits as well — so direct invocations behave consistently.
-   **`null` Config = "Don't Instantiate"**: Every detector field in `ClientMonitorConfig` is now typed as `Type | null`. Passing `null` for a detector skips its construction entirely (no instance, no `update()` overhead). Passing `undefined` (the omitted case) still applies the documented defaults; passing an object enables the detector with the provided overrides.
-   **Ergonomic `Detectors` Registry**: The `Detectors` registry attached at every level (`monitor.detectors`, `peerConnectionMonitor.detectors`, track-level `detectors`) now exposes a proper public API for inspection and runtime toggling: `size`, `has(name)`, `getByName<T>(name)`, `find(pred)`, `filter(pred)`, iteration (`for (const d of detectors)`), and the toggle helpers `disable(name)` / `enable(name)` / `disableAll()` / `enableAll()` / `isEnabled(name)`. The previous mutation API (`add` / `remove` / `clear` / `update` / `listOfNames`) is preserved.

### Breaking Changes

-   **Logger API Refactor**: Removed the global `setLogger` API in favor of instance-level logger injection via `ClientMonitor`.
-   **Removed**: `ClientMonitor.resolveActiveIssues(type, issueOrFilter, comment?)` is gone. Callers that resolved stateful issues should switch to `raiseIssue` + `resolveIssue(key, …)`.
-   **Changed**: `ClientMonitor.activeIssues` shape — was `Record<string, ClientIssue[]>` (mutable, sometimes containing stringified payloads), now a `Map<string, RaisedClientIssue>` keyed by issue `key`. Use `getActiveIssuesByType(type?)` / `isIssueActive(key)` instead of `Object.keys` / index access.
-   **Removed**: `createIssue?: boolean` from every detector's config block (`videoFreezesDetector`, `dryInboundTrackDetector`, `dryOutboundTrackDetector`, `audioDesyncDetector`, `congestionDetector`, `cpuPerformanceDetector`, `playoutDiscrepancyDetector`). Whether a detector raises an issue is now the detector's own decision; applications that do not want issues from a particular detector should pass `null` for that detector's config, or flip `detector.disabled = true` at runtime.
-   **Removed**: `disabled?: boolean` from every detector's config block. The flag now lives on the detector instance (`detector.disabled`). The new `Detector` interface includes an optional `disabled?: boolean` so custom detectors can opt in.
-   **Renamed event**: `'resolved-issue'` is now `'issue-resolved'` for consistency with `'issue-updated'`.
-   **Type rename / shape**: `ClientIssue` is now a discriminated union of `AddedClientIssue | RaisedClientIssue`. The wire format on `ClientSample.clientIssues` is unchanged (`{ type, payload?: string, timestamp }`), but in-memory issues carry richer fields. `ResolvedClientIssue` extends `RaisedClientIssue` (which carries `key`, `raisedAt`, `updatedAt`).

### Improvements

-   **Logger Propagation**: `ClientMonitor` now propagates the same logger instance to sources and monitors.
-   **Module-Prefixed Logs**: Internal logs now include module prefixes such as `[ClientMonitor]:` and `[Sources]:` for easier filtering.

### Bug Fixes

-   **`activeIssues` payload corruption**: Previously, `addIssue` stored a JSON-stringified payload in `activeIssues` while emitting the original object via `'issue'`. Every detector's resolve filter then tried to read `(issue.payload as Record).trackId` off a string and silently failed — issues never resolved, the active store grew unbounded. Fixed: in-memory issues keep the original payload object; stringification happens only at sample-serialization time.
-   **Resolution return value**: The old `resolveActiveIssues` returned the *remaining* issues, not the resolved ones, contradicting its name. The new `resolveIssue` returns the resolved issue (or `undefined` if no match).
-   **Reference-equality dead branch**: `resolveActiveIssues(type, issueObject)` could never match because the stored object was a copy of the input. The new API takes a `key` string, eliminating the foot-gun.
-   **`'issue'` event gated on sampling**: Issue events were silently dropped when sampling was disabled and `bufferingEventsForSamples` was false. Event emission is now unconditional; only the sample buffer is gated.
-   **Dry-track detectors spammed events**: `DryInboundTrackDetector` and `DryOutboundTrackDetector` fired their detector-specific event (and re-raised the issue) on every update tick while the dry condition persisted. They now emit exactly once per episode, mirroring the pattern in `AudioDesyncDetector` / `CongestionDetector`.
-   **Extension Stats Providers**: Fixed provider execution in `collect()` so configured extension stat providers are executed and appended to samples correctly.

### Helpers

-   **`AudioDesyncIssuePayload`, `CongestionIssuePayload`, `CpuPerformanceIssuePayload`, `DryInboundTrackIssuePayload`, `DryOutboundTrackIssuePayload`, `FreezedVideoTrackIssuePayload`, `PlayoutDiscrepancyIssuePayload`** are now exported from the package root, so applications can import the exact payload type for each detector.
-   **Resolved issues carry `durationInMs`** on the payload for episode-length detectors (`audio-desync`, `congestion`, `cpulimitation`, `dry-inbound-track`, `dry-outbound-track`, `freezed-video-track`, `inbound-video-playout-discrepancy`). The detector measures the time from `raise` → `resolve` and merges it into the resolved payload.
-   **Auto-resolve on `close()`**: `ClientMonitor.close()` now resolves every still-active issue with `comment: 'monitor closed before issue could be resolved'`, so consumers see a clean lifecycle even if the call drops mid-incident.

### Migration

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `monitor.addIssue({ type: 'congestion', payload: { … } })` (for a resolvable issue) | `monitor.raiseIssue('congestion-pc-1', { type: 'congestion', payload: { … } })` |
| `monitor.addIssue({ type: 'USER_MEDIA_ERROR', payload: { … } })` (fire-and-forget) | Unchanged — `addIssue` still does the right thing for one-shot logs. |
| `monitor.resolveActiveIssues('congestion', issue => issue.payload.peerConnectionId === 'pc-1')` | `monitor.resolveIssue('congestion-pc-1')` |
| `monitor.activeIssues['congestion']?.[0]` | `monitor.getActiveIssuesByType('congestion')[0]` |
| `monitor.config.congestionDetector.disabled = true` | `peerConnectionMonitor.detectors`-located instance: `detector.disabled = true`; **or** at construction time: `new ClientMonitor({ congestionDetector: null })` to skip instantiation entirely. |
| `monitor.config.audioDesyncDetector.createIssue = false` | Removed. Pass `audioDesyncDetector: null` to skip, or flip `detector.disabled` at runtime. |
| `monitor.on('resolved-issue', …)` | `monitor.on('issue-resolved', …)` |

### Documentation

-   **README**: Rewrote the "Events and Issues" section to cover the new lifecycle, the `ClientMonitorIssue` discriminated union, the `disabled` runtime toggle, the `null`-disables-instantiation config semantics, and end-to-end examples for every built-in detector.
-   **README Logging Section**: Expanded logging documentation with basic, production-adapter, and no-op logger examples.
-   **Score Calculation Notes**: Documented outbound video scoring behavior for screen-share tracks (`contentHint: 'screen'`).

## 2.3.0

-   refactored collectors and sampler
-   `clientMontior.os` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.operationSystem`
-   `clientMontior.engine` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.engine`
-   `clientMontior.browser` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.browser`
-   `clientMontior.audioInputs` is moved to `clientMonitor.meta.audioInputs`

## 2.1.0

-   Remove dependency @observertc/samples-schema
-   Add Samples and W3cStats to the source under the `./src/schema` library

## 2.0.0

### Conceptual changes

-   The ClientMonitor is no longer responsible for WebSocket connections, signaling, and transports.
-   The ClientMonitor has become responsible for the following event emissions:
    -   PEER_CONNECTION_OPENED, PEER_CONNECTION_CLOSED
    -   MEDIA_TRACK_ADDED, MEDIA_TRACK_REMOVED
    -   ICE_CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGED
-   Specific collectors can add additional call events. For example, mediasoup adds PRODUCER_PAUSED, PRODUCER_RESUMED, CONSUMER_PAUSED, CONSUMER_RESUMED events.
-   ClientMonitor calculate derived metrics such as sending, and receiving bitrates, total sent and received packets.

### Major Code changes

-   Removed Sender component and corresponding configuration from ClientMonitor.
-   Removed Transport component, as sending and transporting no longer fall under the responsibility of the ClientMonitor.
-   Storage StatsEntries `id` is renamed to `statsId`.
-   PeerConnectionEntry `collectorId` is renamed to `id`, and `collectorLabel` to `label`.
-   Removed `setUserId`, `setCallId`, `setClientId`, `setRoomId`, and `marker` from ClientMonitor, as this information should be used for context creation on the server side, which falls under the responsibility of signaling.
-   Removed `events` field from ClientMonitor, as events have become part of the ClientMonitor itself, and ClientMonitor now provides `on`, `off`, `once` interfaces for events.

### Functionality changes

-   Stats are removed based on visited ids in getStats. If a stat is no longer present in the getStats extracted result, it is removed from the Storage.

### Configuration changes

-   Sampler configuration is reduced.
-   Sender configuration is removed.
-   `statsExpirationTimeInMs` is removed.
-   `createCallEvents` is added.
